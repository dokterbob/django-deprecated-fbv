django-deprecated-fbv
=====================

Deprecated Django function based views from Django 1.4 in a neat little package. Ugly little hack for deadlines and emergencies where Django 1.5 or 1.6 is necessary.

Usage
-----
1. `pip install django-deprecated-fbv`
2. Change imports from `django.views.generic` into `deprecated_fbv`.
3. Consider a more sensible strategy, like fixing your code to get rid of those pesky deprecation errors (yes, I left them in place).
